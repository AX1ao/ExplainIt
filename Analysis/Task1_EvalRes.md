## Insights

## üîç Insights: Task 1 ‚Äî LLAVA One Vision Performance (Manual Review)

### ‚úÖ Overall Accuracy & Reasoning Trends

- **Explanation-first prompts performed best overall**, with 4/10 earning a perfect 2* score (flawless reasoning and correct answer), and only 1 prompt scoring below 2. This confirms that structured, reason-guided prompting helps the model produce more accurate and chemically grounded outputs.
- **Stepwise prompts showed moderate reliability**, often capturing the correct reasoning chain but occasionally failing at the final conclusion (e.g., Set 1 ‚Äî Aniline vs Nitrobenzene). They tend to guide attention but not always judgment.
- **Visual-first prompts were highly variable**. Some relied on superficial pattern-matching or vague observations (e.g., ‚Äúmore atoms = more reactive‚Äù), leading to correct answers with weak logic or wrong answers entirely.
- **Baseline prompts often got the right answer** ‚Äî especially for well-known comparisons ‚Äî but lacked chemical justification. In several sets (e.g., Chlorobenzene), the model defaulted to incorrect intuition without structured support.

---

### üß† Reasoning Quality & Chemical Understanding

- LLAVA One Vision demonstrates **solid memorization of archetypal chemical behaviors** (e.g., reactivity of OH, NO‚ÇÇ, and CH‚ÇÉ groups).
- However, the model sometimes confuses **acid/base concepts** with **electrophilic substitution reactivity** ‚Äî especially in cases involving ‚ÄìCOOH and ‚ÄìCHO (Set 3).
- Nitrogen heterocycles reveal the model‚Äôs **limits in understanding aromatic systems** ‚Äî e.g., pyridine vs pyrrole ‚Äî where it often misjudges electron donation/withdrawal unless explicitly guided by the prompt.

---

### üß™ Key Observations

- **Correct answers ‚â† correct reasoning**: Baseline and visual prompts sometimes yield right answers but with flawed logic ‚Äî indicating brittle, surface-level generalization.
- **Prompt scaffolding boosts reasoning**: Structured prompts, especially Explanation-first, consistently help the model produce chemically sound justifications.
- **Failure cases are instructive**: Misclassifications like ‚Äúchlorobenzene is more reactive‚Äù show overreliance on simple heuristics (e.g., "bigger group = stronger effect").

### ‚úÖ Overall Accuracy & Reasoning Trends

- **Explanation-first prompts were consistently excellent** ‚Äî 7 out of 10 scored a perfect **2\***. This suggests that LLaVA-Med responds well to chemically scaffolded reasoning, delivering both correct answers and high-quality justification.
- **Baseline, Stepwise, and Visual-first** all performed uniformly well across most tasks ‚Äî until presented with difficult or misleading input (e.g. multiple EWGs), where **Stepwise and Visual-first failed** to apply deeper reasoning.
- The **model struggled significantly with electron-withdrawing groups** like ‚ÄìCl. In both hexachlorinated examples (Pairs 8 & 9), only Explanation-first was able to override superficial group-counting heuristics and reason chemically.

---

### üß† Reasoning Quality & Chemical Understanding

- **Donation vs withdrawal effects** were clearly recognized in prompts that invoked reasoning explicitly. Baseline and Visual-first often ignored these effects or applied them incorrectly in complex substitutions.
- LLaVA-Med tends to default to **"more groups = more reactive"** when unprompted, leading to poor outcomes in Pairs 8 & 9 where this heuristic breaks.
- When prompted through **Explanation-first**, the model was able to articulate ideas like **inductive withdrawal**, **resonance donation**, and **ortho/para activation** with high accuracy.

---

### üß™ Key Observations

- **Consistent correct performance** in pairs involving ‚ÄìOH and other clear EDGs.
- **Systematic failure in Cl-rich rings** without guided reasoning ‚Äî revealing a key model vulnerability.
- **Strong reliance on Explanation-first prompts** to activate chemically correct generalizations, especially in edge cases.

### ‚ùå Overall Behavior

- Despite using the **correct model** (`deepseek-vl-7b-chat`), **DeepSeek refused to process visual content** across all CoT prompts.
- Only the **baseline prompt** returned any output ‚Äî and even then, responses were **vague, generic, or wrong**.
- All **stepwise**, **visual-first**, and **explanation-first** prompts triggered the model‚Äôs fallback safety phrase:
  > *‚ÄúAs an AI language model, I cannot observe or analyze images.‚Äù*

This behavior persisted across all 10 image pairs.

---

### üß† Reasoning Quality (Baseline Only)

- The model **sometimes guessed correctly** (e.g., Toluene > Benzene, Phenol > Benzene), but **never explained why**.
- In some cases, it gave **confident but incorrect answers** (e.g., Nitrobenzene > Aniline).
- All reasoning-heavy prompt types failed completely, making **visual comparison and chain-of-thought analysis impossible**.

---

### üß™ Root Cause (Diagnosis)

- The failure likely stems from **incorrect input formatting** in the script:
  - Images were passed using a legacy `{"images": [path1, path2]}` format.
  - DeepSeek-VL expects structured input like:
    ```json
    {"type": "image", "image": <path>}
    {"type": "text", "text": <prompt>}
    ```
- As a result, the model **defaulted to text-only mode** and hallucinated blindness.

### üìä Prompt Type Effectiveness (Average Score Comparison)

| Prompt Type     | Avg Score (/2) |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Explanation     | 0.0            |
| Stepwise        | 0.0            |
| Visual-first    | 0.0            |
| Baseline        | **1.0**        |

---

### üîß Recommendations

- ‚úÖ **Fix the input format** to explicitly include image-type content blocks.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Avoid large batch loading** ‚Äî DeepSeek-VL is memory-intensive and may silently fail on T4 GPUs.
- ‚úÖ Test first with a **single image-prompt pair** and confirm visual reasoning is working.
- üß™ Consider switching to `deepseek-vl-1.3b` or other lighter models for debugging purposes.
