A molecule can often be identified by analyzing its key features:  
- The types of atoms present (e.g., carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen).  
- The connectivity between atoms, such as rings, chains, or branches.  
- Specific functional groups like hydroxyl (OH), carbonyl (C=O), or amine (NHâ‚‚).
Now, examine the given image.  
Which atoms and structural patterns are present?  
Based on these observations and known chemical structures, what is the most likely identity of this molecule?
