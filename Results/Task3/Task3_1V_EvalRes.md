### ‚úÖ Overall Accuracy & Reasoning Trends

- **Explanation-first prompts dominated** once again ‚Äî 9 out of 10 image pairs scored a perfect **2\***, showing that LLaVA performs best when given structured, theory-rich prompts.
- **Stepwise prompts were also highly effective**, scoring 2s across all pairs. The model benefits from guided reasoning that helps it isolate key features like lone pair availability and inductive effects.
- **Baseline prompts showed good intuition**, often guessing the right answer but failing to articulate why ‚Äî many responses relied on phrases like ‚Äúmore reactive‚Äù or ‚Äúmore groups‚Äù without clear chemical justification.
- **Visual-first prompts remained the weakest**, with low reasoning density. The model tended to focus on visible atom counts or general structural complexity without applying underlying chemical principles.

---

### üß† Chemical Reasoning Quality

- The model understands key nucleophilicity factors well under guided prompts:
  - **Lone pair availability** (e.g. amines vs aromatics)
  - **Resonance delocalization** as a deactivator (e.g. acetate vs methoxide)
  - **Electronegativity and atomic properties** (e.g. nitrogen vs oxygen)
- It also handles subtle cases like **imidazole vs pyridine** and **furan vs thiophene** when explicitly prompted to consider electron delocalization or aromatic effects.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Observed Failure Modes

- **Visual-first responses** often reduce to group counting: ‚Äúthis one has more nitrogens‚Äù or ‚Äúoxygen is more reactive‚Äù ‚Äî without discussing electron donation or reactivity.
- **Baseline prompts** occasionally hallucinate cause-effect claims (e.g., ‚Äúbenzoic acid is more nucleophilic because of the acid group‚Äù), indicating the model defaults to general chemical familiarity unless prompted to reason.
- In the absence of stepwise or explanation formats, **resonance and inductive effects are rarely mentioned**, even when essential to the correct answer.

### ‚úÖ Overall Accuracy & Prompt Trends

- **Explanation-first prompts were clearly the strongest**, with 9 out of 10 earning perfect or near-perfect scores (7√ó 2\*, 2√ó 2). These prompts consistently elicited accurate comparisons involving electron density, resonance, and lone pair availability.
- **Baseline prompts performed moderately well**, with correct answers in 8 out of 10 cases, though the chemical reasoning was often vague or shallow.
- **Visual-first prompts were weak**, mostly providing superficial structure mentions (e.g., ‚Äúhas more groups‚Äù) without mechanistic understanding. They often guessed correctly but could not justify the outcome.
- **Stepwise prompts were missing** for all 10 pairs, leading to 0s across the board for that category. This makes direct comparison difficult but underscores the importance of verifying model response completeness.

### üß† Chemical Understanding Highlights

- LLaVA-Med correctly applies principles of **electronegativity, resonance delocalization, and conjugation** when given the chance to reason step-by-step or explain directly.
- The model recognizes **inductive effects** well, particularly for groups like ‚ÄìNO‚ÇÇ or ‚ÄìOH vs ‚ÄìSH, as seen in comparisons like morpholine vs piperidine and DTT vs catechol.
- In borderline cases (e.g., imidazole vs 2-aminobenzimide), **Explanation-first** prompts yielded chemically correct and detailed answers, while other prompt types either failed or made incorrect assumptions.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Observed Weaknesses

- Visual-first responses consistently lack depth, defaulting to heuristics like "more groups = more reactive."
- Baseline responses often assume familiarity without actual reasoning ‚Äî they occasionally hallucinate relationships between structure and function.
- The total absence of Stepwise responses may reflect either a runtime/model error or prompt incompatibility. Regardless, the absence prevents one of the most pedagogically useful prompt types from being evaluated.
