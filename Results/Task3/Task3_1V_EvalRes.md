## üìä Prompt Type Trends

- **Baseline:** Tends to guess correctly in simpler comparisons but often lacks chemical justification. Best when structural difference is obvious.
- **Stepwise:** Clearly the strongest performer. Its structure helped models apply electron-based logic (e.g., lone pair availability, resonance suppression).
- **Visual-first:** Weakest performer again. Even with obvious visuals (e.g. O vs S), most responses stayed superficial.
- **Explanation-first:** Matches Stepwise in accuracy. Triggered resonance, hybridization, and delocalization reasoning consistently.

## üö® Common Failure Modes

- **Visual-first** prompts yielded low performance due to their observational-only nature.
- Baseline prompts often landed correct conclusions but lacked clear mechanistic insight.
- In a few tricky cases (e.g. benzoic acid vs benzaldehyde), some answers flipped the expected nucleophilicity trend due to misunderstanding electron-withdrawing groups.

## üèÖ Best Performing Images

- **Ammonia vs Methanol** and **MeNH‚ÇÇ vs Aniline**: Nearly all prompt types got these right with solid reasoning.
- **Furan vs Thiophene**: Multiple prompts discussed heteroatom electronegativity correctly.
- **Histamine vs Imidazole**: Strong reasoning on lone pair accessibility by both Stepwise and Explanation-first.

## ‚ùå Worst Performing Images

- **Benzaldehyde vs Benzoic acid**: Baseline and Visual-first both failed; few explanations accounted for carbonyl reactivity properly.
- **Nicotinamide vs Purine**: All prompts gave vague or incorrect reasoning.
- **Pyrrole vs Pyridine**: Baseline chose the wrong nucleophile; others were hesitant.

---

# üîç Detailed Insights by Category

## 1. Correct Identifications often involved:

- Discussing lone pair location (sp¬≤ vs sp¬≥ vs conjugated)
- Recognizing resonance or conjugation reducing nucleophilicity
- Using electronegativity to compare O, N, and S atoms
- Comparing substituent effects on reactivity

## 2. Partial Identifications were seen when:

- The model chose correctly but didn‚Äôt explain why
- It listed atom types or functional groups without mechanism
- It hesitated or used hedging language (‚Äúmight be more reactive‚Äù)

## 3. Incorrect Identifications still included:

- Reversed logic (e.g., saying benzoic acid more nucleophilic than benzaldehyde)
- Treating all heteroatoms as equally reactive
- Ignoring delocalization or aromatic suppression

# üßæ Prompt Type Performance Summary

| Prompt Type       | Strengths                                                                 | Weaknesses                                                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Baseline**      | Quick, sometimes right on common-sense comparisons                        | Lacks explanation; cannot handle nuanced resonance or hybridization logic |
| **Stepwise**      | Very strong on structural and mechanistic breakdown                       | Occasionally over-explains or loses momentum before reaching a conclusion |
| **Visual-first**  | Picks up on obvious atom/group visuals                                    | Rarely applies electron logic or chemical rules                           |
| **Explanation-first** | Brings in chemical principles like EN, hybridization, resonance           | Sometimes verbose; logic chain may drift if molecule is unfamiliar        |

# ü™û Final Reflection

In nucleophilicity comparison, accuracy depends heavily on understanding **electron density and accessibility**, not just visual structure. Prompts that encouraged **mechanistic reasoning** (like Stepwise and Explanation-first) dramatically outperformed others, especially in comparisons involving **resonance suppression**, **heteroatom substitution**, or **conjugation**.

Once again, we see that **prompt engineering is a decisive factor** in model performance. The success of Stepwise and Explanation-first prompts highlights how language structure can scaffold scientific thinking ‚Äî even for complex molecular comparisons.
