## üìä Prompt Type Trends

- **Baseline:** Performed best when the acid/base difference was textbook clear (e.g., benzoic vs phenol), but lacked depth in trickier comparisons. Often made vague, under-explained claims.
- **Stepwise:** Most consistently accurate. It helped the model break down structural features and build a clear answer. Only weak when molecule function was very complex.
- **Visual-first:** Struggled the most. Without chemical reasoning, most responses stayed observational or uncertain. Accuracy suffered unless visual difference was very obvious.
- **Explanation-first:** On par with Stepwise in performance. These prompts triggered detailed reasoning, especially about electron effects, resonance, and lone pairs. Weak only when the model got lost in abstract language.

## üö® Common Failure Modes

- **Visual-first prompts** often produced vague atom/group descriptions with no real judgment.
- **Caffeine vs Morphine** and **Nicotinamide vs Histamine** repeatedly confused the model due to complex, unfamiliar pharmacological structures.
- Many **Baseline** responses gave correct guesses with no mechanistic justification.
- Some **Stepwise** prompts collapsed into listing features without concluding.

## üèÖ Best Performing Images

- **Benzoic_acid vs Phenol**: All 4 prompts got it right with clear, confident reasoning.
- **Formic_acid vs Acetic-acid** and **H2O vs Methanol**: Great performance especially from Stepwise and Explanation-first.
- **Ibuprofen vs Salicylic-acid**: Clear advantage in salicylic acid, well picked up by multiple prompt types.

## ‚ùå Worst Performing Images

- **Caffeine vs Morphine**: All prompt types failed or hedged.
- **Nicotinamide vs Histamine**: Multiple prompts gave no real analysis.
- **Cytosine vs Adenine**: No strong reasoning, and only 1 correct-ish answer from 4 prompts.

# üîç Detailed Insights by Category

## 1. Correct Identifications often involved:

- Functional group comparisons (COOH vs OH)
- Charge stabilization (resonance, inductive effects)
- Clear reasoning steps or structured breakdown
- References to electron-withdrawing/donating effects

## 2. Partial Identifications were seen when:

- The model made a correct pick but gave incomplete or vague justification
- Prompts were more observational than analytical
- Multiple factors were mentioned but not weighed properly

## 3. Incorrect Identifications still included:

- Descriptions without judgment (‚ÄúX has a methyl group‚Ä¶‚Äù with no follow-up)
- Focus on irrelevant features (e.g. brain receptors)
- Mixing up acidity vs basicity, or not picking a side at all

# üßæ Prompt Type Performance Summary

| Prompt Type       | Strengths                                                                 | Weaknesses                                                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Baseline**      | Can land correct answers on familiar comparisons; simple structure helps  | Often lacks reasoning; guesses with vague or no justification              |
| **Stepwise**      | Best overall performer; supports detailed, logical structure               | Sometimes lists features without reaching a conclusion                     |
| **Visual-first**  | Useful only when structures are extremely distinct                        | Mostly observational, avoids conclusions, lacks chemical logic             |
| **Explanation-first** | Triggers mechanistic and theoretical knowledge; strong on charge effects | Can ramble or drift when the chemistry is too abstract                     |

---

# ü™û Final Reflection

The results show that **structured prompts** like **Stepwise** and **Explanation-first** are far more effective at eliciting correct, reasoned chemical comparisons. **Baseline** works when the task is easy and familiar. **Visual-first**, while intuitive for multimodal reasoning, underperforms in chemistry tasks where internal reasoning, not appearance, determines reactivity.

This evaluation confirms: for complex domain tasks like acid/base comparison, **prompt design matters more than model size** ‚Äî and the right reasoning chain can unlock far better performance.
