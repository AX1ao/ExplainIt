## üìä Prompt Type Trends

- **Baseline:** Never produced a fully correct answer. At best, it guessed correctly with no reasoning. Most responses were vague or off-topic, especially in complex molecule comparisons.
- **Stepwise:** A strong performer (70% correct). The structured approach helped the model identify acidity/basicity trends using electron effects, lone pairs, and resonance.
- **Visual-first:** Performed poorly with only 1 correct answer. It remained mostly descriptive, unable to apply chemical logic beyond visual pattern recognition.
- **Explanation-first:** Matched Stepwise in correctness. Prompted models to invoke resonance, inductive effects, and hybridization ‚Äî but sometimes too abstract or hesitant.

---

## üö® Common Failure Modes

- **Visual-first prompts** yielded shallow comparisons ‚Äî they often listed groups or atoms without conclusions.
- **Baseline** produced multiple off-topic answers (e.g. Caffeine, Nicotinamide) and guessed without reasoning.
- **Cytosine vs Adenine** and **Caffeine vs Morphine** tripped up all prompt types due to ambiguous structure and poor domain familiarity.
- Some **Stepwise** and **Explanation-first** prompts stopped short of a confident judgment even with decent chemical framing.

---

## üèÖ Best Performing Images

- **Benzoic_acid vs Phenol**: All four prompts answered correctly with clear, mechanistic logic.
- **Formic_acid vs Acetic-acid** and **H2O vs Methanol**: Strong results from Stepwise and Explanation-first due to clear trends in electron effects.
- **Ibuprofen vs Salicylic-acid**: All prompt types except Baseline gave chemically grounded conclusions.

---

## ‚ùå Worst Performing Images

- **Caffeine vs Morphine**: Baseline, Stepwise, and Visual-first all failed; only Explanation-first showed partial reasoning.
- **Nicotinamide vs Histamine**: All prompts gave vague or off-topic responses.
- **Cytosine vs Adenine**: None gave a fully correct response. Only partial reasoning was observed.

---

# üîç Detailed Insights by Category

## 1. Correct Identifications often involved:

- Recognizing acidic functional groups (e.g. COOH vs OH)
- Delocalization effects in anions (e.g. resonance in phenol vs ethanol)
- Inductive influence of substituents (e.g. methyl in acetic acid)
- Accurate hybridization and lone pair availability comparisons

## 2. Partial Identifications were seen when:

- The model picked the correct molecule but failed to explain why
- Atom/group lists were correct but not analyzed for reactivity
- The reasoning was hedged or lacked follow-through

## 3. Incorrect Identifications still included:

- Flipping correct acid/base roles (e.g. benzoic vs benzaldehyde)
- Confusing solubility or bonding with acidity
- Failing to mention or weigh key structural features

# üßæ Prompt Type Performance Summary

| Prompt Type       | Strengths                                                                 | Weaknesses                                                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Baseline**      | Rarely helpful; sometimes lucky guesses                                   | 0 correct answers; vague, off-topic, or irrelevant reasoning               |
| **Stepwise**      | Excellent at guiding correct reasoning via chemical structure breakdowns  | Occasionally hesitant to commit to a conclusion                           |
| **Visual-first**  | Can recognize clear structural differences visually                       | Lacks chemical reactivity logic; failed in most comparisons                |
| **Explanation-first** | Elicits deep chemical reasoning (e.g. resonance, EN, lone pairs)         | Sometimes over-explains or trails off without judgment                    |

# ü™û Final Reflection

The corrected analysis makes it clear: **structured prompts** are not just helpful ‚Äî they‚Äôre essential for accurate chemical comparisons. **Baseline** and **Visual-first** approaches are largely ineffective in this domain, often offering vague guesses or surface-level observations. 

Meanwhile, **Stepwise and Explanation-first** prompts tap into the model‚Äôs latent chemistry knowledge. They scaffold its reasoning and enable it to correctly interpret acidity/basicity based on **electron effects, resonance, and hybridization**.

This study confirms that **prompt quality, not model identity**, is the single most powerful lever for improving performance in scientific reasoning tasks.
