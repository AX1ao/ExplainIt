Step 3: Say which molecule is stronger, the first or the second, and explain why.","To determine the most acidic or basic site in each molecule, we need to consider the Lewis acid-base theory. In this theory, a molecule can act as a Lewis acid or a Lewis base, depending on the number of unshared electrons it has.

Step 1: Identify the most acidic or basic site in each molecule.

1. H2O: The molecule has a lone pair of electrons on the oxygen atom, making it a Lewis base. The most acidic site is the oxygen atom.

2. CH4: The molecule has a tetrahedral structure with no unshared electrons, making it a Lewis acid. The most basic site is the carbon atom.

3. NH3: The molecule has a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom, making it a Lewis base. The most acidic site is the nitrogen atom.

4. CO2: The molecule has a linear structure with a double bond between the carbon and oxygen atoms, making it a Lewis acid. The most basic site is the carbon atom.

Step 2: Consider how stable the molecule is after gaining or losing a proton.

1. H2O: Gaining a proton (H+) would make it a stronger Lewis base, as it would have a more stable electron pair.

2. CH4: Losing a proton (H+) would make it a weaker Lewis acid, as it would have a less stable electron pair.

3. NH3: Gaining a proton (H+) would make it a stronger Lewis base, as it would have a more stable electron pair.

4. CO2: Losing a proton (H+) would make it a weaker Lewis acid, as it would have a less stable electron pair.

Step 3: Say which molecule is stronger, the first or the second, and explain why.

1. H2O: The first molecule (H2O) is stronger than the second molecule (NH3) because it has a more stable electron pair, making it a stronger Lewis base.

2. CH4: The second molecule (CH4) is stronger than the first molecule (H2O) because it has a more stable electron pair, making it a stronger Lewis acid.

3. NH3: The first molecule (H2O) is stronger than the second molecule (NH3) because it has a more stable electron pair, making it a stronger Lewis base.

H2SO4 is a strong acid. It dissociates completely in water to form H+ ions and SO4^2- ions. The H+ ions are released into the solution, while the SO4^2- ions remain in the acid. This results in a stable charge, with a higher concentration of H+ ions than SO4^2- ions.

Step 1: Identify the most acidic or basic site in each molecule.

1. H2O: The molecule has a lone pair of electrons on the oxygen atom, making it a Lewis base. The most acidic site is the oxygen atom.

2. CH4: The molecule has a tetrahedral structure with no unshared electrons, making it a Lewis acid. The most basic site is the carbon atom.

3. NH3: The molecule has a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom, making it a Lewis base. The most acidic site is the nitrogen atom.

4. CO2: The molecule has a linear structure with a double bond between the carbon and oxygen atoms, making it a Lewis acid. The most basic site is the carbon atom.

Step 2: Consider how stable the molecule is after gaining or losing a proton.

1. H2O: Gaining a proton (H+) would make it a stronger Lewis base, as it would have a more stable electron pair.

2. CH4: Losing a proton (H+) would make it a weaker Lewis acid, as it would have a less stable electron pair.

3. NH3: Gaining a proton (H+) would make it a stronger Lewis base, as it would have a more stable electron pair.

4. CO2: Losing a proton (H+) would make it a weaker Lewis acid, as it would have a less stable electron pair.

Step 3: Say which molecule is stronger, the first or the second, and explain why.

1. H2O: The first molecule (H2O) is stronger than the second molecule (NH3) because it has a more stable electron pair, making it a stronger Lewis base.

2. CH4: The second molecule (CH4) is stronger than the first molecule (H2O) because it has a more stable electron pair, making it a stronger Lewis acid.

3. NH3: The first molecule (H2O) is stronger than the second molecule (NH3) because it has a more stable electron pair, making it a stronger Lewis base.

Analyze both molecules, then conclude which is stronger: first or second.","To determine the acid/base strength, we need to analyze the molecules and their ability to stabilize the charge after proton gain or loss.

First molecule: H2SO4 (sulfuric acid)
H2SO4 is a strong acid. It dissociates completely in water to form H+ ions and SO4^2- ions. The H+ ions are released into the solution, while the SO4^2- ions remain in the acid. This results in a stable charge, with a higher concentration of H+ ions than SO4^2- ions.

Second molecule: H2CO3 (carbonic acid)
H2CO3 is a weak acid. It dissociates in water to form H+ ions and CO3^2- ions. However, the H+ ions are not released as quickly as in the case of H2SO4. Instead, they are partially buffered by the CO3^2- ions, which remain in the solution. This results in a less stable charge, with a lower concentration of H+ ions than CO3^2- ions.

Based on the analysis, H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) is a stronger acid than H2CO3 (carbonic acid) because it has a higher concentration of H+ ions and a more stable charge."
