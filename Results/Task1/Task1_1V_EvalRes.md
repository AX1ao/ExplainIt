## ðŸ“‹ Overall CoT Evaluation Results

| CoT Type           | Accuracy Summary         | Notes                                           |
|:-------------------|:--------------------------|:------------------------------------------------|
| Baseline           | âœ… All 10/10 Correct (2/2) | Perfect logical identification and reactivity |
| Stepwise           | âœ… All 10/10 Correct (2/2) | Clear breakdown helped model infer reactivity |
| Visual-first       | âœ… All 10/10 Correct (2/2) | Good at noticing key structural features      |
| Explanation-first  | âœ… All 10/10 Correct (2/2) | Effective chemical reasoning from features    |

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Verdict

- **Every CoT type** (Baseline, Stepwise, Visual-first, Explanation-first) achieved **perfect performance (2/2 scores) across all 10 molecule pairs**.
- **No single strategy failed**:  
  - Baseline prompts alone were already highly effective.
  - Stepwise prompts reinforced reasoning structure.
  - Visual-first prompts correctly highlighted activating/deactivating groups visually.
  - Explanation-first prompts successfully connected visual features to chemical principles.

- **Model's Strength at Task 1**:  
  The model showed **strong domain knowledge** in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactivity prediction, **once clear visual and functional group clues were available**.

## ðŸš€ Insights for Future Work

- **Task 1 success suggests** that when the goal is relatively "shallow" chemical decision-making (based on visible groups and simple electron effects), **even minimal CoT or baseline prompts are sufficient**.
- **More complex tasks** (requiring multi-step mechanistic predictions or less obvious reactivity trends) **may benefit more** from enhanced CoT prompting.

âœ… **Conclusion**:  
In Task 1, all four prompting styles enabled perfect model performance â€” demonstrating that the model is highly competent at simple chemistry visual reasoning with modest prompting support.
