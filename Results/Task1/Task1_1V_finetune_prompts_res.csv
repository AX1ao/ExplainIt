Given that the visual layout of groups within the ring is indicative of molecular properties, it is logical that a more electron-rich and attractive molecule would have a higher molecular weight relative to the molecular weight of the ring structure.
Therefore, a molecule appearing more electron-rich and attractive to an electrophile would have a higher molecular weight relative to the molecular weight of the ring structure.
This can be illustrated by considering a molecule appearing more electron-rich and attractive to an electrophile would have a higher molecular weight relative to the molecular weight of the ring structure.

Electron-withdrawing groups decrease EAS reactivity. Considering this, explain which molecule's structure favors substitution more.assistant
Substitution occurs when an electron with a withdrawing group loses its reactivity, lowering the overall reactivity of a molecule, as the structure of a molecule influences its reactivity differently compared to its overall reactivity.

Structures with an electron withdrawing group lose reactivity when an electron with the withdrawing group moves towards a non-reactive reactivity, such as a molecule with a non-reactive reactivity.

When an electron with a withdrawing group moves towards reactivity, the reactivity of a molecule increases due to the influence of a molecule's overall reactivity on its reactivity differently compared to its overall reactivity.

Reactivity is influenced by the reactivity of a molecule differently compared to its overall reactivity when an electron moves towards or away from non-reactive reactivity.

A structure with an electron losing reactivity due to an electron with a non-reactive reactivity moves away from reactivity when an electron with the non-reactive reactivity moves towards reactivity.

In summary, reactivity is influenced by the reactivity of a molecule differently compared to its overall reactivity when an electron moves towards or away from non-reactive reactivity.
