## Insights

## üîç Insights: Task 1 ‚Äî LLAVA One Vision Performance (Manual Review)

### ‚úÖ Overall Accuracy & Reasoning Trends

- **Explanation-first prompts performed best overall**, with 4/10 earning a perfect 2* score (flawless reasoning and correct answer), and only 1 prompt scoring below 2. This confirms that structured, reason-guided prompting helps the model produce more accurate and chemically grounded outputs.
- **Stepwise prompts showed moderate reliability**, often capturing the correct reasoning chain but occasionally failing at the final conclusion (e.g., Set 1 ‚Äî Aniline vs Nitrobenzene). They tend to guide attention but not always judgment.
- **Visual-first prompts were highly variable**. Some relied on superficial pattern-matching or vague observations (e.g., ‚Äúmore atoms = more reactive‚Äù), leading to correct answers with weak logic or wrong answers entirely.
- **Baseline prompts often got the right answer** ‚Äî especially for well-known comparisons ‚Äî but lacked chemical justification. In several sets (e.g., Chlorobenzene), the model defaulted to incorrect intuition without structured support.

---

### üß† Reasoning Quality & Chemical Understanding

- LLAVA One Vision demonstrates **solid memorization of archetypal chemical behaviors** (e.g., reactivity of OH, NO‚ÇÇ, and CH‚ÇÉ groups).
- However, the model sometimes confuses **acid/base concepts** with **electrophilic substitution reactivity** ‚Äî especially in cases involving ‚ÄìCOOH and ‚ÄìCHO (Set 3).
- Nitrogen heterocycles reveal the model‚Äôs **limits in understanding aromatic systems** ‚Äî e.g., pyridine vs pyrrole ‚Äî where it often misjudges electron donation/withdrawal unless explicitly guided by the prompt.

---

### üß™ Key Observations

- **Correct answers ‚â† correct reasoning**: Baseline and visual prompts sometimes yield right answers but with flawed logic ‚Äî indicating brittle, surface-level generalization.
- **Prompt scaffolding boosts reasoning**: Structured prompts, especially Explanation-first, consistently help the model produce chemically sound justifications.
- **Failure cases are instructive**: Misclassifications like ‚Äúchlorobenzene is more reactive‚Äù show overreliance on simple heuristics (e.g., "bigger group = stronger effect").

### üìä Prompt Type Effectiveness (Average Score Comparison)

| Prompt Type     | Avg Score (/2) |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Explanation     | **2.0** (w/ 4√ó 2*) |
| Stepwise        | 1.2            |
| Visual-first    | 1.1            |
| Baseline        | 1.3            |
