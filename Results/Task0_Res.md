# Full Text Analysis

**Overview:**
The model was tasked with *Task 0: identifying the molecule* in each image. We used four prompt structures: **Baseline**, **Stepwise**, **Visual-first**, and **Explanation-first**.

---

## Key Findings:
- **Baseline prompts** often led to major misidentifications or very generic guesses.
- **Stepwise prompts** improved logical flow but still missed functional groups.
- **Visual-first prompts** improved structure detection but missed small groups.
- **Explanation-first prompts** had the best overall performance.

---

## Accuracy Summary:

| Accuracy Level         | Count |
|-------------------------|-------|
| ✅ Correct              | 46    |
| ⚠️ Partially Correct    | 34    |
| ❌ Incorrect            | 22    |

---

## Observations:

- **Common Failure Mode 1:** Confusing benzene derivatives.
- **Common Failure Mode 2:** Missing small functional groups (hydroxyls, amines).
- **Common Failure Mode 3:** Miscounting carbons/hydrogens in chains.
- **Common Success Pattern:** Structured explanations (especially "explanation-first") helped the model organize details better and recognize correct features.

---

# Conclusion

Adding **structured Chain-of-Thought prompting**, especially **Explanation-first**, significantly improves molecular recognition accuracy.

Small functional groups and substitution patterns remain challenging even with better prompting.
