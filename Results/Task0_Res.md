# Full Text Analysis

**Overview:**
The model was tasked with *Task 0: identifying the molecule* in each image. We used four prompt structures: **Baseline**, **Stepwise**, **Visual-first**, and **Explanation-first**.

---

## Key Findings:
- **Baseline prompts** often resulted in major misidentifications or overgeneralizations.
- **Stepwise prompts** helped improve structure recognition but often failed to correctly capture functional groups.
- **Visual-first prompts** generally improved detection of large features like rings and chains but frequently missed small functional groups.
- **Explanation-first prompts** showed the best overall performance, guiding the model to recognize functional groups and bond patterns more accurately.

---

## Accuracy Summary:

| Accuracy Level         | Count |
|-------------------------|-------|
| ✅ Correct              | 12    |
| ⚠️ Partially Correct    | 18    |
| ❌ Incorrect            | 10    |

---

## Observations:

- **Common Failure Mode 1:** Mistaking benzene rings for other cyclic compounds when substitutions were small.
- **Common Failure Mode 2:** Missing critical functional groups (like hydroxyl or amine) unless the prompt specifically asked for them.
- **Common Failure Mode 3:** Miscounting carbons or hydrogens when the image was crowded or unlabeled.
- **Common Success Pattern:** When prompted to explain *features first* (Explanation-first), models more reliably identified correct functional groups and structural patterns.
- **Special Cases:** Complex molecules (like Aspartame) still caused confusion even under better prompt designs.

# Conclusion

Adding structured thinking (especially Explanation-first) **dramatically improves** molecule recognition for complex diagrams. However, subtle substitutions and functional group identifications **remain weak points**, even with Chain of Thought prompting.
