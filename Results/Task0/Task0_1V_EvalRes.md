## Overview

This evaluation focused on the model's ability to **identify molecules** purely from images, across **four prompt types**:
- Baseline
- Stepwise
- Visual-first
- Explanation-first

Each of the 19 molecules was tested under these prompts. The results were scored as:
- ✅ Correct = 2
- ⚠️ Partially Correct = 1
- ❌ Incorrect = 0

## 📈 Accuracy Summary (After Finetuned Prompts)

| Accuracy Level         | Count |
|-------------------------|-------|
| ✅ Correct              | 39    |
| ⚠️ Partially Correct    | 28    |
| ❌ Incorrect            | 9     |

## General Observations

- **Success Rate**:  
  After prompt finetuning, **correct identifications increased noticeably** across Visual-first and Explanation-first prompts.  
  Partial recognitions also became **more focused** — models were more often "almost right" than totally wrong.

- **Prompt Type Trends**:  
  - **Baseline**: Still weak overall; occasional correct guesses for very simple molecules.  
  - **Stepwise**: Improved feature listing, but struggled with final chemical naming.  
  - **Visual-first**: **Significantly improved** — rings, bonds, and overall structure recognition became more accurate.  
  - **Explanation-first**: **More reliable** after finetuning — stronger functional group identification and logical molecule deduction.

- **Common Failure Modes**:
  - **Confusing structurally similar molecules** (e.g., benzene vs cyclohexane)
  - **Overcomplicating straight chains** (e.g., butane misinterpreted)
  - **Missing or hallucinating functional groups** (e.g., missed hydroxyl groups)

- **Best Performing Images**:
  - **Carbon-dioxide**: Correctly and consistently identified.
  - **Phenol2.png**: Ring and functional group captured well after finetuning.
  - **Furan-numbered.png**: Ring structures correctly recognized, especially by Visual-first prompts.

- **Worst Performing Images**:
  - **Guainin.png**: Still frequent confusion with caffeine or other nucleobases.
  - **Hydrogen-chloride.png**: Simple diatomic structure still misdescribed under several prompts.
  - **Butane_simple.png**: Overinterpreted into zigzag or polymeric structures.

## Detailed Insights by Category

### 1. Correct Identifications (✅)

Correct outputs often involved:
- Clear **visual patterns** (e.g., double bonds, aromatic rings).
- **Visual-first** prompts improving model attention to spatial arrangement.
- **Explanation-first** prompts correctly anchoring observed structures to chemical knowledge after finetuning.

Finetuned prompts helped **Visual-first** and **Explanation-first** especially.

### 2. Partial Identifications (⚠️)

Partial answers were seen when:
- General **shapes or rings were described correctly**, but specific groupings were wrong.
- Stepwise prompts walked through features but **faltered at final naming**.
- Functional groups were **missed or misnamed** despite good general layout understanding.

Stepwise prompts remained **decent at reasoning but weak at final classification**.

### 3. Incorrect Identifications (❌)

Mistakes still included:
- **Hallucinated complex structures** for simple molecules.
- **Confused similar groups** (e.g., ketones, alcohols, amines).
- **Overgeneralized** from visible features without domain knowledge.

Baseline prompts remained unreliable unless the molecule was **extremely simple**.

## Prompt Type Performance Summary

| Prompt Type      | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|------------------|-----------|------------|
| **Baseline**     | Sometimes catches very obvious features | Frequently vague or wrong |
| **Stepwise**     | Good at step-by-step visual breakdown | Often weak at full molecule naming |
| **Visual-first** | **Much better** after finetuning; stronger at recognizing rings, bond patterns | Still some issues with functional group specificity |
| **Explanation-first** | **Significantly improved** chemical logic; better group identification | Occasionally too verbose or overcomplicated |

---

## Final Reflection

Task 0 ("Identify the molecule") with **finetuned prompts** **substantially improved both partial and full identifications**, especially for Visual-first and Explanation-first structures.

Compared to the earlier raw prompts:
- **More correct answers** were achieved overall.
- **Partial answers** were **closer to full correctness** (more "almost right" cases).
- **Visual-first prompts benefited the most**, showing the importance of anchoring reasoning to **visible molecular patterns**.

**However**, the model still **struggles to bridge vision and domain-specific chemical naming**.  
Correct CoT structure **alone** is **not sufficient** — models **need deeper chemical grounding** to move beyond surface features.

# 📊 Quick Performance Comparison: Before vs After Finetuning

| Metric | Before Finetuning | After Finetuning |
|:-------|:------------------|:-----------------|
| % Correct Outputs | Low (~30%) | Moderate (~50–60%) |
| Best Prompt Type | None clearly better | Visual-first and Explanation-first |
| Failure Mode | Random misidentifications | More focused, near-correct attempts |

---

# ✨ Final Verdict

**Finetuned prompting worked.**  
It **did not make the model perfect**, but it **increased the chance of the model finding the correct or nearly correct molecule** — a meaningful step toward smarter multimodal scientific reasoning.
