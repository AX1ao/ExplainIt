### üèÜ Top Performing Prompts (Based on Manual Scoring)

1. **Prompt #1** ‚Äì Most consistently solid output, especially early on.
2. **Prompt #16** ‚Äì One genuinely strong and relevant answer with chemical accuracy.
3. **Prompt #17** ‚Äì One strong and two decent attempts; best balance in the latter half.
4. **Prompt #19** ‚Äì Several fluffy but structured answers; more potential than earlier ones.
5. **Prompt #4** ‚Äì Steady format, occasionally led to structured reasoning.

### üîç Key Observations

- **Good prompts ‚â† good completions** ‚Äî many well-designed prompts triggered template repetition or hallucination.
- **Visual understanding seemed unreliable** ‚Äî most correct answers came from simple or familiar cases (e.g., Aniline vs Phenol).
- **Prompt looping and degenerate output** was the most common failure mode (esp. in Prompts #5, #10, #15).
- **Only 5 completions scored 2/2 out of 200 total**, most from just 3 molecule pairs.
- Prompts that directly asked the model to ‚Äúdecide‚Äù at the end fared better than vague or fragmentary ones.
 heteroatom effects ‚Äî which are central to predicting nucleophilic strength.

Ultimately, this task reaffirms that **prompt structure is not cosmetic** ‚Äî it fundamentally alters how models think.
