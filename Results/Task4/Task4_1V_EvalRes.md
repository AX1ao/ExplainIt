## üìä Prompt Type Trends

- **Baseline:** Never got a fully correct answer. Most responses were surface-level guesses without chemical reasoning. Only useful when the correct answer happened to be obvious.
- **Stepwise:** Among the top performers with 70% accuracy. These prompts led the model to structure its analysis, often identifying correct trends in lone pair localization and hybridization.
- **Visual-first:** Failed to produce a single fully correct answer. Even with obvious visual contrasts, the model stuck to neutral or hesitant language. Lacked any chemical insight.
- **Explanation-first:** Matched Stepwise in correctness (7/10). Helped trigger discussions about resonance and delocalization, but occasionally veered into vague or verbose responses.

---

## üö® Common Failure Modes

- **Visual-first** prompts consistently produced vague, observational content with no real conclusion.
- **Baseline** prompts showed a strong tendency to guess, sometimes aligning with the correct answer, but lacked reliable chemical logic.
- **Electron-withdrawing group effects** were misunderstood or ignored ‚Äî notably in benzoic acid vs benzaldehyde.
- Some **partially correct Stepwise and Explanation-first** responses over-described structures without concluding which was more nucleophilic.

---

## üèÖ Best Performing Images

- **Ammonia vs Methanol** and **MeNH‚ÇÇ vs Aniline**: Clear-cut differences allowed Stepwise and Explanation-first to excel.
- **Furan vs Thiophene**: Strong contrast in heteroatom electronegativity was correctly used by Stepwise and Explanation-first.
- **Histamine vs Imidazole**: Nucleophilic N site in histamine was consistently identified by both strong prompt types.

---

## ‚ùå Worst Performing Images

- **Benzaldehyde vs Benzoic acid**: Baseline and Visual-first both failed. Few models explained carbonyl nucleophilicity or carboxyl suppression.
- **Nicotinamide vs Purine**: All prompt types were hesitant or incorrect. Complex structure confused reasoning.
- **Pyrrole vs Pyridine**: Baseline made an incorrect call; Visual-first and Explanation-first both hesitated despite clear trends in lone pair delocalization.

---

# üîç Detailed Insights by Category

## 1. Correct Identifications often involved:

- Step-by-step breakdown of reactive centers (e.g. lone pair availability, hybridization)
- Recognition of resonance suppression (e.g. in aniline, phenol)
- Electronegative atom comparisons (e.g. O vs S, N vs O)
- Clear comparisons of sp¬≤ vs sp¬≥ lone pair geometry

## 2. Partial Identifications were seen when:

- The model made a correct guess but failed to explain why
- It described structural features (e.g. atom types) without interpretation
- It hedged its language (‚Äúmight be more reactive‚Äù or ‚Äúlikely‚Äù)

## 3. Incorrect Identifications still included:

- Choosing less nucleophilic species due to resonance misunderstanding
- Assuming more atoms = more reactive (e.g. histamine logic in Baseline)
- Using vague or irrelevant criteria (e.g. "simpler" or "bulkier")

# üßæ Prompt Type Performance Summary

| Prompt Type       | Strengths                                                                 | Weaknesses                                                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Baseline**      | Sometimes aligns with simple comparisons                                  | No correct answers; lacks chemical reasoning; guesses blindly              |
| **Stepwise**      | Strong at guiding structured chemical logic (hybridization, resonance)    | Sometimes over-literal; partials happen when no clear conclusion is made   |
| **Visual-first**  | Identifies obvious visual differences (atoms/groups)                      | 0 correct answers; lacks reactivity logic; only visual features            |
| **Explanation-first** | Triggers deep reasoning (resonance, lone pairs, conjugation)             | Occasionally verbose or too abstract for unfamiliar molecules              |

---

# ü™û Final Reflection

In nucleophilicity comparisons, models can only succeed when the prompt scaffolds **chemical reasoning** ‚Äî not just recognition. The complete failure of Visual-first and Baseline to produce correct answers highlights the **inadequacy of unstructured or shallow prompts**.

Meanwhile, both **Stepwise and Explanation-first** successfully triggered discussions about lone pair localization, resonance suppression, and heteroatom effects ‚Äî which are central to predicting nucleophilic strength.

Ultimately, this task reaffirms that **prompt structure is not cosmetic** ‚Äî it fundamentally alters how models think.
