    "If a molecule can stabilize a negative or positive charge through resonance or electronegativity, it‚Äôs likely to be stronger. Which of these does that better?",
    "Functional groups like carboxylic acids, amines, and phenols influence acidity or basicity. Which molecule has more reactive groups?",
    "Based on the molecular structures, think about where each molecule could gain or lose a proton. Which would be more favorable?",
