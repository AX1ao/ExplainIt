# Final chosen prompts

| CoT Type | Best Prompt Text (Short Summary) |
|:---------|:---------------------------------|
| Baseline | "Which molecule is more reactive toward electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), the first or the second? Why?" |
| Stepwise #3 | "First, note if the ring has electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups. Then, determine which molecule is more reactive toward electrophilic substitution." |
| Visual-first #9 | "Observe visible features: are there -OH, -NHâ‚‚, or -NOâ‚‚ groups? Count and compare electron-donating versus electron-withdrawing groups for both molecules." |
| Explanation-first #16 | "Consider the net electronic effect (donating vs withdrawing) based on the visible substituents. Then predict which molecule will react faster toward EAS." |
