|------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| ðŸ¥‡   | Prompt 1 | Analyze each molecule in steps. First, identify the leaving group. Then, consider how stable the carbocation would be if that group left. Finally, determine which molecule favors an SN1 mechanism. | Highest score overall (2 full + 2 partial); clear structure |
| ðŸ¥ˆ   | Prompt 2 | Step by step: (1) Whatâ€™s the leaving group in each molecule? (2) If it leaves, how stable is the resulting carbocation? (3) Based on that, which molecule is more likely to follow SN1? | Strong logical breakdown of SN1 logic            |
| ðŸ¥‰   | Prompt 17 | Which molecule loses its leaving group more easily? Which forms a stable carbocation? Use these steps to predict which one undergoes SN1 more readily. | Compact wording; best performance on harder pairs |

|------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| ðŸ¥‡   | Prompt 1 | Look at the structure of both molecules. Which one has a group that looks easier to break off? Use this to decide which could follow an SN1 path. | Most balanced performance (1 good, 2 partial); directly targets leaving group |
| ðŸ¥ˆ   | Prompt 5 | Scan each molecule for ring structures or conjugated systems near the leaving group site. Which structure looks more capable of dispersing charge? | Strong conceptual grounding in SN1 (resonance/carbocation stability) |
| ðŸ¥‰   | Prompt 12 | Observe how isolated the leaving group appears in each structure. Which one looks more "exposed" or weakly connected â€” a possible sign of easier SN1 departure? | Good visual heuristic; performed well on simple examples like Aniline vs Phenol |

| ðŸ¥‡   | Prompt 14 | The best SN1 substrates are those where the leaving group leaves easily, and the molecule can stabilize the resulting positive charge. Based on this, which one is a better candidate? | Strongest performer overall (1 good + 4 partial); clear SN1 logic |
| ðŸ¥ˆ   | Prompt 3  | The more stable the carbocation intermediate, the more likely an SN1 mechanism will occur. Consider how the structure of each molecule affects the stability of its carbocation. | One perfect (2/2) and two partial completions     |
| ðŸ¥‰   | Prompt 9  | Molecules that undergo SN1 easily often contain benzylic or allylic positions that stabilize carbocations. Does either molecule contain such a feature? | Specific, well-scoped SN1 condition; consistently structured answers |
