| ðŸ¥‡   | 1                    |Analyze each molecule in steps. First, identify the leaving group. Then, consider how stable the carbocation would be if that group left. Finally, determine which molecule favors an SN1 mechanism. | Scored highest (2 full, 2 partial); clear structure |
| ðŸ¥ˆ   | 2                    |Step by step: (1) Whatâ€™s the leaving group in each molecule? (2) If it leaves, how stable is the resulting carbocation? (3) Based on that, which molecule is more likely to follow SN1? | Clean logical decomposition of SN1 steps         |
| ðŸ¥‰   | 17                   |  Which molecule loses its leaving group more easily? Which forms a stable carbocation? Use these steps to predict which one undergoes SN1 more readily. | Strong completions on harder pairs; very concise |
