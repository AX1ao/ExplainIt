| Prompt Type         | Final Selected Prompt                                                                                                                                           | Abbr. Reason for Chosen                                     |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Baseline**        | "Which molecule is more likely to undergo an SN1 reaction, and why?" *(default)*                                                                                | Default phrasing; clean anchor for comparison                |
| **Stepwise**        | "Letâ€™s evaluate both molecules for SN1 reactivity: (i) Leaving group ability, (ii) Carbocation stability, (iii) Steric accessibility. Then decide which is more favorable." | Best overall structure + highest consistent usability        |
| **Visual-First**    | "Identify any aromatic rings adjacent to the site of bond cleavage. Which molecule is better positioned to stabilize the resulting structure through resonance?" | One of few prompts that elicited molecule-specific logic     |
| **Explanation-First** | "The best SN1 substrates are those where the leaving group leaves easily, and the molecule can stabilize the resulting positive charge. Based on this, which one is a better candidate?" | Only expl-first prompt with 1 good + 4 partial completions   |
